I'm cleaning out my old hard drive, and I found a bunch of old AppleScripts snippets that formed the basis for some of the benchmarking programs that I've written for Tom's Hardware and other publications. Feel free to use them in any of your projects. 

Frankly, a lot of what I wrote as far as proprietary benchmarks was in AppleScript because it was easier to maintain than doing it in C, but the linearized nature of the run made the benchmark somewhat limited in certain uses. Executing and manipulating multiple programs concurrently isn't really possible if you limit yourself to AppleScripts alone. Many of my peers continue to utilize either something simple in AppleScript or a combination of AppleScript and another Object-oriented language to harness more flexibility for their benchmarking needs.
